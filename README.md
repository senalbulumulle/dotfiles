## thinkpad-t480-arch-linux




This branch is used to store configuration files for the ThinkPad T480 with Arch Linux.




With the ThinkPad T480, I use this device as a dedicated writing machine as well as using
this device as a second brain. Some of the features in this branch, will completely amaze
you, and probably modivate you to be creative, productive, as well as having a second brain.
