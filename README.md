# Introduction

Welcome to Senal's dotfiles repository, the official repository 
of typical Senal's habitat. Work Smarter Always and Not Harder


# Notices on other branches


The other branches in my dotfiles contain more configuration files 
and some of those configurations are based from the linux distribution's
configuration files, but it is archived for my use-cases, if I need to 
port the files to the main branch
