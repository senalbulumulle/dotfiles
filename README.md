## macos-apple-sllicon




This branch is used to store configuration files for macOS on Apple Sllicon.

Senal's Configuration files are used for his poweruser :-)









### Neovim Configurations

In this section, we are going to be talking about the neovim configurations.
For the neovim configurations, this is synced from the main branches.


Since I'm getting into Neovim recently, some of the Neovim Distributions
you going to noticed are forked for me to learn and inspire for my own 
NeoVIM distribution, which is in the making.




In this branch, this complete setup is designed for Senal for his workflow in macOS
