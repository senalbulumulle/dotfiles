alpine-linux

These scripts are used for configuring alpine linux with 
my dotfiles



How does the installation work?


Well, we are going to be talking about that here. Well, basically
how I do is the bootstrapping method of installing alpine linux
on top of a live Arch Linux iso environment.

- downloaded an arch based distribution
- install the balenaetcher or use the command to flash the usb stick
- make sure to connect to the WiFi
- make sure that Firefox is pre-installed on the live-iso
- cd to /tmp only
- download the apk static from wiki/ Bootstrapping_Alpine_Linux




TODOs i guess...

- Make a complete script to automatically install my setup of alpine linux 
  on a live environment
