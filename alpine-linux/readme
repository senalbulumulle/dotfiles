alpine-linux

These scripts are used for configuring alpine linux with 
my dotfiles




How does the installation work?


Well, we are going to be talking about that here. Well, basically
how I do is the bootstrapping method of installing alpine linux
on top of a live Arch Linux iso environment.


1. downloaded the CachyOS (Arch Based) distribution
2. make sure to connect to the WiFi
3. make sure that Firefox is pre-installed on the live-iso
